Below write your group's answers to the questions posed in studio

Question A1: What do you see in both plots?  Are there any
differences between the two?  What could account for those differences?

Your answer:

<B>Question A2:</B> Why do the times provided for <KBD>Quadratic</KBD> produce such a nice
plot, while the original values of <KBD>Linear</KBD> did not?

Your answer:

<B>Question A3:</B> From the runs you have tried so far, how does
the placement of <KBD>ticker.tick()</KBD> calls affect the plots you see?
In particular, do the changes affect the shapes of the curves, the values
plotted, or both?

Your answer:

<B>Question A4:</B> In terms of <KBD>n</KBD>, how would you characterize, in the
most simple terms, the time and
ticks curves that have been generated so far?

Your answer

 <B>Question A5:</B> What would happen if you deleted <em>all</em> <KBD>ticker.tick()</KBD> calls
in the innermost loop, while leaving other calls to <KBD>ticker.tick()</KBD>
that you just placed in <KBD>run()</KBD>?

Your answer


<B>Question B1:</B> What do you see? How do the curves reflect the code inside
<KBD>AddsTwoNumbers</KBD>?
<P>
   Do you think the value of <KBD>n</KBD> matters here in terms of
the time it takes to perform the operation?  Why or why not

Your answer

<B>Question B2:</B> What do the data and plot tell you about the time it takes
to allocate an array of <KBD>n</KBD> integers?
  <p> Is it reasonable to say that the line of code
<PRE>
     this.array = new int[this.n]
</PRE>
takes a constant amount of time, independent of the value of <KBD>this.n</KBD>?

your answer

<B>Question B3:</B> Do the ticks agree in shape with the time we measured in running the
<KBD>Allocates</KBD> code?

your answer

<B>Question B4:</B>  Are the plots more similar to each other than before?
What does this tell you about how much time it takes to allocate an array
of <KBD>n</KBD> integers?

Your answer

<LI>
Which group do you expect to finish first?  
<LI> Can you formalize, in terms
of <KBD>n</KBD> the amount of work (ticks) that each group must do to
write <KBD>n</KBD> in the form required for that group?
</UL>
<p>
Both groups achieve the same result, namely the recording of
an integer <KBD>n</KBD>.
<UL>
<LI> Under what circumstances is the decimal notation more efficient than
tally marks?
<LI> Under what circumstances is the tally mark notation more efficient
than decimal notation?
