Part A

What are three data types that can serve as T?
String, Integer, Double.

Which class did you pick to examine its compareTo method?
Byte.

How did its compareTo method impose a natural order on that class's instances?
Subtract one byte from another, and 
1) if it returns zero, then they are equal.
2) if it returns a positive number, then the first byte is larger.
3) if it returns a negative number, then the second byte is larger.

Part B

How does compareTo work?  Does it always return either -1, 0, or +1?
It returns a negative or positive number or zero. No, not always -1,0,1.

Part C

From your inspection of the LinkedList<T> class's source code:
Given a LinkedList<T> of size n, what is the asymptotic complexity, worst-case, 
for performing each of the following operations?

  1)  Appending to the end of that list  addLast(..)
  Θ(1); worst-case is 1 (constant time).
  
  2)  Prepending to the beginning of that list   addFirst(...)
  Θ(1); worst-case is 1 (constant time).
  
  3)  Inserting an element in the middle of the list  add(size/2, .....)
  O(n). n/2.
  
And for your implementation of a PriorityQueue using the Unordered List, 
given n elements already in the queue, what is the asymptotic complexity, 
worst-case for performing each of the following operations?
  
  4)  extractMin
  O(n); worst-case is n.
  
  5)  insert
  Θ(1); worst-case is 1 (constant time).
  
  6)  isEmpty
  Θ(1); worst-case is 1 (constant time).
  
Part D

From your implementation of OrderedArray, what is the asymptotic complexity, worst-case, for performing each of the following operations?

  1)  Adding an element at the end of the array
  
  
  2)  Inserting an element at the beginning of the array
  
  
  3)  Inserting an element in the middle of the list

And for your implementation of a PriorityQueue using the Ordered Array, 
given n elements already in the queue, what is the asymptotic complexity, 
worst-case for performing each of the following operations?
  
  4)  extractMin
  
  5)  insert
  
  6)  isEmpty
  
 
 Are there situations when you would want to use the OrderedArray or the UnorderedList instead of
 the binary heap described in class?   Explain please.
